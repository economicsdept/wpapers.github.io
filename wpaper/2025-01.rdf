Title:  Price Gouging or Market Forces? Fairness Perceptions of Price Hikes during the Pandemic
Abstract:  When and under what circumstances might people interpret a price increase as fair and
acceptable is an important question in behavioral economics. We report the results of surveys we
conducted in the US and Israel in 2020, a time when many prices increased following the spread
of the COVID-19 pandemic. To assess respondents’ fairness perceptions of price increases, we
focus on goods whose prices have increased during the pandemic, including some essential goods.
Consistent with the principle of dual entitlement, we find that respondents perceive price increases
as fairer if they are due to cost shocks than if they are due to demand shocks. However, we also
find large differences across the two populations, as well as across goods.
