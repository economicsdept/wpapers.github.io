Title: Will Automation and Robotics lead to more inequality?
Abstract: This paper presents a new framework for analyzing automation, robotics, and high-
tech, which differs from the canonical model of technological progress by
incorporating the higher education system. The main difference is that there is not just
one type of skilled workers, but two types, and there is not one type of education but
two - elite universities and standard ones. The gap between these two types of
education is called 'elitism gap'.
The 'elitism gap' in the higher-education sector enables a separation of individuals
by their abilities. Since the economy is divided between low-tech and high-tech
sectors, the elitism gap leads to a separating equilibrium in which, high-ability
workers graduating from top universities work in the high-tech sector, while low-
ability workers, graduate from standard universities and work in the low-tech
industries. In consequence, human capital in both industries is different, which leads
to wage inequality.
We then analyze the effects of an increased use of robotics on inequality. We show
that robots affect the “matching effect” between abilities and education, and in
consequence, inequality increases. We also show that wages and productivity gaps
between high-tech and low-tech sectors are fueled by the elitism gap in higher
education. This leads to heterogeneity in human capital, and therefore to an increase
in wage inequality.
We develop an index of the elitism gap, and show a positive correlation between
the index of elitism gap and inequality in OECD countries.
