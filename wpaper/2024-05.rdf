Title:Large Effects of Small Cues: Priming Selfish Economic Decisions
Abstract:Many experimental studies report that economics students tend to act more
selfishly than students of other disciplines, a finding that received widespread
public and professional attention. Two main explanations that the existing literature
offers for the differences found in the behavior between economists and non-economists 
 are: (i) the selection effect, and (ii) the indoctrination effect. We offer an alternative,
novel explanation: we argue that these differences can be explained by differences in the
interpretation of the context. We test this hypothesis by conducting two social dilemma
experiments in the US and Israel with participants from both economics and non-economics majors.
In the experiments, participants face a tradeoff between profit maximization (market norm)
and workers’ welfare (social norm). We use priming to manipulate the cues that the participants
receive before they make their decision. We find that when participants receive cues signaling
that the decision has an economic context, both economics and non-economics students
tend to maximize profits. When the participants receive cues emphasizing social norms,
on the other hand, both economics and non-economics students are less likely to maximize profits.
We conclude that some of the differences found between the decisions of economics and non-economics
students can be explained by contextual cues.
