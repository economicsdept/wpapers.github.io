Title:  Sticky information and price controls: Evidence from a natural experiment
Abstract:  We test the predictions of the sticky information model using a survey dataset by comparing
shoppers’ accuracy in recalling the prices of regulated and comparable unregulated products. Because
regulated product prices are capped, they are sold more than comparable unregulated products, while
their prices change less frequently and vary less across stores and between brands, than the prices of
comparable unregulated products. Therefore, shoppers would be expected to recall the regulated product
prices more accurately. However, we find that shoppers are better at recalling the prices of unregulated
products, in line with the sticky information model which predicts that shoppers will be more attentive
to prices that change more frequently.
